## Statsig JavaScript Client SDK

The JavaScript SDK for single user client environments. For usage in React Native, check out our [Expo SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native-expo), or [React Native SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native) if you are not using Expo, both of which are based on this JavaScript SDK.

If you're looking to use Statsig in a multi-user server environment, try our [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/node-js-server-sdk).

Statsig helps you move faster with Feature Gates and Dynamic Configs.  If you're new to Statsig, create an account at [statsig.com](https://www.statsig.com).
